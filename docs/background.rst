The canonical spherical harmonics :math:`Y_{lm}` subject to a rotation in 
:math:`\mathbb{R}^{3}` will always mix among each other. As such, we can
represent the act of rotating the spherical harmonics by the following
matrix-vector equation

.. math::
  \vec{Y}_{l}\prime = \mathbf{D}\vec{Y}_{l}

wherein :math:`\mathbf{D}` is the `Wigner D-matrix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_D-matrix>`_
and :math:`\vec{Y}_{l}` a vector composed of the canonical spherical harmonics
of order :math:`l`. The vector :math:`\vec{Y}_{l}\prime` is the linear combination that
represents the result of the rotation upon the (linear combination) of
spherical harmonics prior to the rotation.
