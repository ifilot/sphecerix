:program:`Sphecerix` is a Python package for rotation and mirror operations among
spherical harmonics using `Wigner-D matrices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_D-matrix>`_.
It accomodates both the `canonical spherical harmonics <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalHarmonic.html>`_ 
as well as the `real (tesseral) spherical harmonics <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TesseralHarmonic.html>`_.

:program:`Sphecerix` has been developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology,
Netherlands. :program:`Sphecerix` and its development are hosted on `github
<https://github.com/ifilot/sphecerix>`_.  Bugs and feature
requests are ideally submitted via the `github issue tracker
<https://github.com/ifilot/sphecerix/issues>`_.
